This project is a comprehensive Image Processing Graphical User Interface (GUI) application developed using Python. The main objective of this application is to provide an easy-to-use platform for applying a wide variety of image processing techniques, including filtering, noise addition, transformations, edge detection, and morphological operations. The application uses powerful libraries such as OpenCV for image processing tasks, Tkinter for the GUI, NumPy for numerical operations, and Matplotlib for histogram visualization.
The application supports loading images from the userâ€™s local machine, applying filters interactively, and viewing results in real-time.
